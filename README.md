# Seed

The starting point for all my Front End Builds. Originally built to run on [Mixture](http://mixture.io), it's now revised to work on grunt. I seem to be setting up the same files and directories when starting front end builds... So why not create the Seed?

## setup

More to remind me than for you to use, clone this into dev, open up terminal and run `npm install`; and then `grunt watch`.
